		<h2>About Bus Ticket Booking system</h2>
		<p>
			<pre style="text-align: left;">
A bus ticket booking system is an online platform that enables users to search, select, and reserve bus tickets for their desired routes.
It offers a convenient and efficient way to plan and book bus travel. 
			<h6>
1. User Registration and Login: Users need to create an account by providing their personal information such as name, contact details, and email address.
 They can then log in to the system using their credentials.
				
2. Search Functionality: The system allows users to search for bus routes based on their preferred departure and arrival locations,
 along with the date and time of travel. The search results provide a list of available buses that match the entered criteria.
				
3. Route Information: Users can access comprehensive details about each bus route, including the departure and arrival points,
 intermediate stops, distance, duration, and fare.
				
4. Seat Selection: The system typically offers a seat map or layout for each bus, enabling users to choose their preferred seats.
 They can view the availability of seats and select one or multiple seats based on their preferences.
				
5. Ticket Reservation: Once the user selects the desired bus and seats, they can proceed to reserve their tickets.
 They need to provide passenger details such as names, ages, and any special requirements.
				
6. Payment Options: Bus ticket booking systems integrate with various payment gateways, allowing users to make secure online payments using credit cards,
 debit cards, net banking, or digital wallets. The system confirms the booking upon successful payment.
				
7. E-Ticket Generation: After the reservation and payment process is completed, the system generates an electronic ticket or e-ticket.
 This ticket serves as proof of the booking and contains important information such as the  departure time, seat number, and ticket number.
				
8. Ticket Cancellation and Refunds: In case of changes in travel plans, users can cancel their tickets through the system.
 The system may have specific cancellation policies and refund procedures, and users can request refunds based on the applicable terms.
				
9. Customer Support: Bus ticket booking systems often provide customer support services to assist users with their queries, concerns,
 or issues related to the booking process or any other aspects of their travel.</h6>
